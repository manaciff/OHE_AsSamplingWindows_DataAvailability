# Univariate model of envelope extent: specification, inference and figures
#
# Manuscript: Assessing the Landscape Composition and Configuration of
#             Threatened Medium- and Large-Sized Mammals using Habitat
#             Envelopes as Sampling Windows
# Author:     Maria Eduarda Nacif
#
# What this script does
#   Asks which forest configuration metrics accompany a larger occupied habitat
#   envelope (OHE), under a candidate set defined a priori. The goal is
#   inference, not prediction.
#
#   1. Six specifications (OLS, linear mixed model and Gamma GLM, each additive
#      or with the a priori interaction) are compared on a common response
#      scale by AICc, by BIC and by exact leave-one-out cross-validation, with
#      leave-one-genus-out beside it. Both criteria are reported because their
#      relative behavior depends on unobserved heterogeneity, which 67 units
#      from nine taxa carry (Brewer et al. 2016).
#   2. The full a priori model is fitted once, without selection. Its
#      coefficients are the inferential result, because inference on
#      coefficients is biased when it follows a selection step (Tredennick et
#      al. 2021; Yates et al. 2023).
#   3. The same model is refitted with the Moran eigenvectors retained by
#      script 02, because an information criterion computed on a non-spatial
#      regression is sensitive to spatial autocorrelation (Diniz-Filho et al.
#      2008).
#   4. The exhaustive search over the candidate subsets is reported as a
#      description of selection uncertainty, not as a second set of estimates.
#
#   The interaction between proximity and forest cover is the only one admitted,
#   because the fragmentation threshold hypothesis is a statement about that
#   interaction rather than about either term alone.
#
#   Three terms of the a priori set, patch density (PD), forest cover (PLAND)
#   and the product of proximity and forest cover, are divided by the window
#   area, which is the response, or built on a term that is. Script 05 shows
#   that their coefficients cannot be interpreted, and the manuscript reports
#   the model of script 05 (Table 4). This script is kept because the a priori
#   analysis is part of the record (Table 3 and the supplementary tables below).

# 5. Choosing the model: six specifications, three criteria --------------------
# The family is chosen by an explicit comparison of the six specifications, not
# by a chain of rules that fits an OLS, tests its assumptions and falls back to
# another family when a test fails. Such a chain never compares the families on
# equal terms and lets one marginal diagnostic settle a structural question.
#
# A common response scale. A model fitted to log(OHE) and a model fitted to OHE
# have likelihoods defined for different response variables, so their
# information criteria are not comparable as they stand. The likelihood of a
# log-scale model is placed on the response scale by subtracting the Jacobian of
# the transformation, sum(log(y_i)). Without that correction the log-scale
# models appear about 1400 AICc units better, an artifact of the scale.
#
# The three criteria, in the order in which they are applied:
#   1. Residual diagnostics. A specification whose simulated residuals fail is
#      not considered, whatever its AICc. This is a gate, not a tie-breaker.
#   2. AICc weight on the common response scale.
#   3. Out-of-sample error in hectares, by exact leave-one-out
#      cross-validation, which settles ties that the AICc leaves open.
# Behind all three stands the nature of the response: the OHE is continuous,
# strictly positive and right-skewed, and its dispersion grows with its mean.

# 8. Exploratory multimodel analysis (Tables S18b, S19 and S20) ----------------
# The candidate subsets of the retained specification are ranked by AICc with
# MuMIn::dredge(). dredge() keeps an interaction only in models that contain both
# of its main effects. The dependency chain dc() adds one more rule: forest cover
# enters only models that contain forest proximity, and the product only models
# that contain both. The candidate set therefore has 8 x 4 = 32 models: the 8
# subsets of PD, FRAC and ENN, crossed with none, PROX, PROX + PLAND, and
# PROX + PLAND + their product.
#
# The competitive set is defined by Delta AICc < 2 (Burnham & Anderson 2002). On
# these data it holds two models, which differ only by Mean_ENN_Forest_m. When
# two or more models are competitive, their coefficients are averaged.
#
# This section describes selection uncertainty across the a priori candidate
# set. It is not the inferential result: its coefficients come after a search
# over 32 subsets, so their standard errors and p-values are conditional on a
# selection step and are biased as inference (Yates et al. 2023). The estimates
# that carry inference are those of Section 6.
#
# Both averaging schemes are reported, because they answer different questions.
# The subset, or conditional, average takes each parameter over the models that
# contain it and describes the effect where it appears (Grueber et al. 2011).
# The full average enters a zero for the models that omit the parameter and is
# the more conservative summary of its support across the whole set.

# 9. Collinearity stability check: PD_Forest and Mean_FRAC_Forest (Table S21) --
# PD_Forest and Mean_FRAC_Forest are moderately correlated and enter the
# retained model with opposite signs (PD negative, FRAC positive). Two correlated
# predictors with opposite-sign effects can reinforce each other in a joint model
# (mutual suppression). The retained model is therefore refitted twice, once
# without PD_Forest and once without Mean_FRAC_Forest, and the coefficients are
# compared with the full model. If a remaining predictor keeps its sign and a
# comparable magnitude, the joint reading is defensible.
#
# The pairwise correlation is reported with Pearson, the measure of linear
# dependence that matches the VIF (Dormann et al. 2013), and with Spearman as a
# cross-check that is robust to skew and outliers (Zuur et al. 2010).

# 15. Figure 7: standardized effect by genus (Table S24) -----------------------
# What is the association of each forest metric with log(OHE), for all species
# together and for each genus separately? The estimate is the standardized
# slope (beta) of a univariate OLS, log(OHE) ~ metric_z, fitted within each
# genus and for all species pooled. The metric keeps its global z-score, so
# beta is the change in log(OHE) per standard deviation of the metric, and all
# rows are on the same scale. The color encodes sign and magnitude (blue for
# negative, vermillion for positive).
#
# Why univariate, and not one model per genus: each genus has between four and
# twelve units, so a multivariable model or an AICc selection inside a genus
# would be overparameterized and unstable. Where a genus has fewer than
# MIN_N_GENUS units, or no variance in the metric, the cell is shown as "n.e."
#
# This figure is a descriptive companion to the models: it shows whether the
# pooled association is shared across genera or driven by a few of them. A
# univariate slope can differ in sign or magnitude from a multivariable
# coefficient, especially for PD_Forest and Mean_FRAC_Forest, which are
# correlated.

# 15.1 Genus slopes with the genus as a moderator (Table S29) ------------------
# The block above fits one model inside each genus, so a genus with four units
# estimates its own residual variance from four units. This block fits one
# model per metric over all 67 units, with the genus as a moderator, so every
# genus slope is read off a single fitted surface and shares one residual
# variance. Genera with few units borrow precision from the rest, and the two
# tables bracket the genus-level result.
#
# The family is Gamma with a log link, as elsewhere in this script, so the
# slopes are on the same multiplicative scale as the models. Each genus slope is
# the linear contrast that adds the reference slope to the interaction term of
# that genus. Its standard error comes from the full covariance matrix of the
# fit, because the two terms are correlated, and its interval uses the t
# quantile on the residual degrees of freedom.
